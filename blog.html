            <br>My lab partner and I headed to the lab today to finish our midterm 
            project--an amplifier circuit for a speaker! We succeeded... kind of. 
            There is a slight bug in our circuit which isn't allowing our variable 
            resistor to act as a volume knob. A quick workaround was to bridge the 
            two input connections, but now the volume control barely works (turning 
            it slightly will max the volume). My partner and I decided that we should 
            revisit this project when the quarter is over. I'm looking foward to going 
            throught the schematic/components and finding the cause of this issue. We also plan on  
            designing and 3D printing an enclosure! My tip: do all of your soldering in one 
            sitting!
