            <aside>
                I am 27 years old, born and raised in Southern California, 
                and a lover of all things science and technology. 
                I just transfered to UCSD this fall and am slowly adjusting to beautiful San Diego. 
                My short term career goals include a Masters in CS and an awesome software engineering 
                internship.<br><br>

            Basically my online journal. I plan on keeping it purely programming and 
            electronics related, with maybe a few random tidbits here and there. 
            Updated once a week on Sundays (but not guaranteed, unfortunately)!
